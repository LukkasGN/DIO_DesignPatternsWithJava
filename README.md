# Java Design Patterns

This repository explores three fundamental **object-oriented design patterns** that are widely used in software development. These patterns help in writing flexible, maintainable, and scalable code by solving common design problems in a reusable way.

## üîÅ Singleton Pattern

**Purpose**:  
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**Key Features**:
- Private constructor to prevent external instantiation
- Static method to return the sole instance
- Useful for logging, configuration, caching, etc.

**Benefits**:
- Controlled access to the single instance
- Reduced memory usage (no unnecessary instances)
- Centralized state management

## ‚öîÔ∏è Strategy Pattern

**Purpose**:  
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

**Key Features**:
- Interface for interchangeable behaviors
- Separate classes implementing the interface
- Context object to switch between strategies dynamically

**Benefits**:
- Promotes open/closed principle
- Eliminates conditional logic
- Allows easy extension of behavior without modifying existing code

## üß∞ Facade Pattern

**Purpose**:  
Provides a unified, simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

**Key Features**:
- Wraps multiple classes with a single high-level API
- Hides subsystem complexity from the client
- Does not restrict direct access to underlying classes if needed

**Benefits**:
- Easier to use and understand complex libraries
- Reduces coupling between subsystems and client code
- Improves code readability and maintainability

## üìö About Design Patterns

Design Patterns are **proven solutions** to common problems in software design. They help standardize approaches to problems, making code easier to understand and collaborate on across teams and projects.

This repository is a starting point for exploring core object-oriented principles like **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, **decoupling**, and **modularity** through these patterns.
